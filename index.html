            <p class="aboutme indent">About me: I started coding June 2014 and I've been hooked ever since. I started with CodeCademy and moved onto books and other websites to learn as much as i could on my own. Soon after i realized how much i loved it and made the decision to do whatever i had to do to make this my career. I've begun working on my AS in CS and plan to finish that within the next 2 years. I also attended LearningFuze Full-Time Developer Bootcamp which has given me a solid foundation in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/jQuery, PHP/MySQL, Twitter Bootstrap and much more.</p>
